= The MEAN Stack: A starters guide

== What this article covers

In this article I‚Äôll cover the MEAN technology stack in general, how to
set it up and build an example application ‚Äì which you can code along!
Let‚Äôs dive in.

== What‚Äôs the MEAN stack?

In one sentence: The MEAN stack is a combination of frameworks used to
build full stack web applications. It is JavaScript based, so every
architecture layer uses it to bring the application to life ‚Äì which can
have many benefits, developer experience wise, but also business wise.

The acronym MEAN stands for the following:

- **M**ongoDB
- **E**xpress
- **A**ngular
- **N**ode.js

Each letter represents one layer: MongoDB as the primary database,
Express and Node act as the backend and Angular makes up for the
frontend. The stack and its variations are very popular, especially with
JavaScript developers. Now, let us have a look at these technologies in
detail.

== The architecture of MEAN

TODO: add MEAN architecture graphic

=== MongoDB as the primary database

'''''

MongoDB is a noSQL document database, that stores Data in flexible JSON
documents. It has over 85 million downloads and is almost the go-to
choice for most developers when it comes to noSQL databases.

A big community and being able to host the database either locally with
docker or with your favourite cloud provider makes Mongo a great choice
as a database.

https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb

=== Express and Node.js for the backend

'''''

Sitting on top of the database, we have our backend server hosted with
Node.js and an Express API.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment mostly acting as a server
for such applications. The ``feature'' making Node outstanding is that
it enables JavaScript to run outside of web-browsers.

It‚Äôs open-source and runs on almost any operating system, if you already
have developed some JavaScript on your device, you have it installed
too!

Express enables our app to talk with our frontend and the outer world,
it‚Äôs our API ‚Äì also based on JavaScript. Powering web applications since
2010 hand in hand with Node.js its service is crucial for the MEAN
stack.

https://expressjs.com/

=== Angular as the frontend

'''''

Firstly developed and published by Google in 2016 ‚Äì as a rewrite of
AngularJS, it is a TypeScript/JavaScript frontend framework for building
small projects and scalable enterprise applications.

Being TypeScript first, safe, and robust development is ensured with
strong types ‚Äì making it extremely popular in enterprise applications. +
The framework handles our complete client-side application including
styling and functionality.

And something special about this guide: we‚Äôll work with *Angular 17*,
which has a lot of updates and new features!

== Variations of the MEAN stack

The frontend framework is the most opinionated discussion around web
developers (JavaScript framework war) and caused the variations of the
MEAN stack.

The framework for the frontend is the only thing that gets switched out
when working with variations of MEAN.

The most popular variations are:

- MERN ‚Äì React
- MEVN - Vue

or with any other frontend framework you like, such as:

- MESN ‚Äì Svelte

But for this article, we‚Äôll stick with the original Angular.

== Who uses the MEAN stack?

I previously mentioned that MEAN is pretty popular, but which companies
do actually use it? Well, here‚Äôs some examples:

- Google (Gmail, Play Store, G Suite)
- Forbes
- Paypal (for its developer portal)
- UpWork

If you were to include the MERN stack, you‚Äôd have even more industry
leaders on that list. That is because React gained a lot of popularity
in the last 3 years.

== Pros of the MEAN stack

=== Only one language

'''''

Having one language for all layers makes it easier to build and maintain
the system as only a developer proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript is
needed ‚Äì and not one which knows many technologies, which may be hard
and expensive to find for a business.

Writing the code in one language is also good for the developer itself
as it creates consistency throughout the project, and you don‚Äôt have to
switch technologies every time you work on different architecture
layers. That may increase your productivity and you can become a very
advanced JavaScript developer when working a lot with the technology.

=== Big community and well supported

'''''

Angular, Express and MongoDB have a very big community and they have
been around for a long time which tells that these frameworks have been
battle tested ‚Äì which is great when developing, because you won‚Äôt have
to migrate your system every time requirements change.

Not only the community is big, also the backers. Having one of the
biggest tech corporations worldwide maintaining Angular is absolutely
great. This ensures high-quality service and security which is crucial
for developing large scale applications.

Moreover, MongoDB is being looked after by MongoDB Inc., the company
that founded the database platform ‚Äì a big pro because the database
really matters.

== Cons of the MEAN stack

Not everything is perfect even the MEAN stack! Sadly, it still has some
flaws which need to be considered as well.

=== No types by default

'''''

JavaScript itself doesn‚Äôt require you to use types which can cause a lot
of chaos in your code ‚Äì imagine using a data object and having to guess
in which format the values are, kinda hard eh?

Of course, that problem is solved by TypeScript ‚Äì but it is not the
default and there are many projects which don‚Äôt use it (just because
they don‚Äôt have to). That makes your code hard to maintain, test and
extend especially for developers that don‚Äôt know your codebase that
well.

=== Logic isolation

'''''

Since we have a tight connected business and server logic it is pretty
hard to separate them ‚Äì often causing üçù(spaghetti)-code, something that
we do not really want for scalable, testable and maintainable applications.

== How to set up a MEAN application

I think you got the core concepts and ideas of MEAN, so let us now have
a look on how to set up a walking-skeleton application! Please note that
this is an opinionated guide ‚Äì you could structure the project
differently as well.

=== What you‚Äôll need to follow along

Before starting to read the guide make sure you have the following
things ready:

* Your favourite IDE (e.g. VS Code, IntelliJ)
* Installed Docker Desktop
* Downloaded and installed Node.js
* Optional: A git repository to publish your code
* Optional: VS Code MongoDB extension

If you got everything ready, go on reading!

=== Setup MongoDB Docker container

'''''

First of all, we need our database. For that we‚Äôll spin up a Docker
container with a MongoDB image.

____
*üìï Note:* You can also host the database on MongoDB Atlas ‚Äì but this is
not covered in this article.
____

Start Docker Desktop and then open your terminal. To pull the latest
image from mongo, enter the following:

[source,shell]
----
docker pull mongo:latest
----

And then run the container with a name you want.

[source,shell]
----
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name=mean-stack-example-mongodb -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=user -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mongo:latest
----

To bind our container port to our machine port we use the `-p` (port)
option. We also want to secure our database with a root admin user,
which can be set with `-e` (environment variable) for username and
password.

To test if our container works, we can open up VS Code and connect to
our database using the MongoDB extension. Just click on the `Add a
connection' button and choose `Connection Settings' ‚Äì which will open a
form to specify the connection.

image::../images/mongodb_form.png[MongoDB VS Code extension set up form]

Enter the username and password from the docker run command and hit
connect! Now you should see the connection in the sidebar and its
databases when expanding the toggle.

image::../images/mongodb_toggle_view.png[MongoDB VS Code extension connected database]

If you want to create a test database with a simple insert, create a new
playground and enter the following:

[source,js]
----
use('test');
db.createCollection('testCollection');
db.testCollection.insertOne({name:"hey there!"})
----

That‚Äôs all you need to know for now. Let us go on and set up our walking
skeleton.

=== Set up the server-side application

'''''

For the sake of simplicity, I will use a mono-repository approach for
this guide, but that‚Äôs not a must ‚Äì feel free to adapt it to your needs.

Open an empty folder/repository in your IDE (the project folder) and
create the folders for the backend:

* `server`
* `server/src`

The src folder is where our Express files will go. Now init a node
project inside the `server` directory.

[source,shell]
----
cd server
npm init
----

And since we want to work with safe types, add a `tsconfig.json` and a
`.env` file for the connection strings to the folder (Leave it empty for now).

We need some npm packages for our Express.js REST API, so install them
in the server directory. And because we are working with typescript, we
also need to add the types for the packages.

[source,shell]
----
npm install cors dotenv express mongodb
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/cors @types/express @types/node ts-node
----

We need `mongodb` to connect our application to the database, and the
`express` package to create our api. `dotenv` and `cors` are for our
communication with the frontend over the api.

And lastly, we need to add some configuration to the `tsconfig.json`
file ‚Äì typescript uses this config to compile the code we write.

*mean-stack-example-app/server/tsconfig.json*

[source,json]
----
{
   "compilerOptions": {
       "module": "commonjs",
       "esModuleInterop": true,
       "target": "es6",
       "noImplicitAny": true,
       "moduleResolution": "node",
       "sourceMap": true,
       "outDir": "dist",
       "baseUrl": ".",
       "allowJs": true,
       "paths": {
           "*": ["node_modules/*"]
       }
   },
   "include": ["src/**/*"]
} 
----

That‚Äôs all for the basic configuration. To see how to connect to the
database and add an express route, read on to the example project.

=== Set up the Angular client

'''''

In the root folder (`mean-stack-example-app`) of the project we need to
install the Angular cli with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
npm install -g @angular/cli
----

After successful installation, again in the root directory, create a new
Angular application:

[source,shell]
----
ng new client --routing --style=css
----

When the initialization is done, we‚Äôll have a client folder where the
Angular app is located. We need the `--routing` flag, so that a routing
module is being generated (for the individual pages of the application).
`--style` makes css our default preprocessor.

Now you can start the application by entering the following in your
terminal:

[source,shell]
----
cd client 
ng serve
----

That‚Äôs everything for setting up the application. If you want to figure
out on your own how to connect to the database, build express endpoints
and create the client pages - feel free to do so now!

For everyone that‚Äôs working with MEAN for the first time, the following
example project is exactly what you need to learn the stack - go on
reading!

== Let‚Äôs build an example project!

The best way to learn is practice ‚Äì that‚Äôs why I‚Äôll build a recipe book
with the MEAN stack! It is a simple CRUD-app, here a sneak-peek on what
it will look like:

*TODO: Add image of application*

=== Add document to MongoDB

'''''

Firstly, we‚Äôll need a document in our database where we can store the
recipes. For that, open up a playground in your VS Code MongoDB extension or your preferred database manager and
add a document.

[source,js]
----
use('test');
db.createCollection('recipes');
----

That's all we need to do on the database directly.

=== Create interfaces on server side for type safety

'''''

Now let us move on to the server side application. Firstly, we need to define what a
recipe looks like by creating a TypeScript interface for it.

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/recipe.ts*

[source,ts]
----
import * as mongodb from "mongodb"

export interface Recipe {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    category: "breakfast" | "main course" | "snack" | "dessert";
    ingredients: object;
    instructions: string;
    _id?: mongodb.ObjectId;
}
----

I decided that a recipe has a title, brief description, category, ingredients (array of
Ingredient interface), instructions and an optional `_id` which will be
generated by MongoDB automatically.

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/ingredient.ts*

[source,ts]
----
import * as mongodb from "mongodb"

export interface Ingredient {
    name: string;
    quantity: number;
    unit: number;
    _id?: mongodb.ObjectId;
}
----

An ingredient consists of a name, quantity and unit. And again the
optional `_id`. That's it for our data model - not that complex but a comprehensive
model is not the main aim of this guide.

=== Connect Express to database

The next step is to connect our backend application to the database.

'''''

For that, create a `database.ts` file in the `src/` folder of the server and add the following code:

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/database.ts*

[source,typescript]
----
import * as mongodb from "mongodb";
import { Recipe } from "./recipe";

export const collections: {
    recipes?: mongodb.Collection<Recipe>;
}={};

export async function connectToMongoDb(uri:string) {
    const client = new mongodb.MongoClient(uri);
    await client.connect();
    
    const db = client.db("test");
 
    const recipesCollection = db.collection<Recipe>("recipes");
    collections.recipes = recipesCollection;
}
----

In this file, I am exporting a `collections` constant, which contains
the recipes from the database. If your database model has more
collections, you can reference them in this object.

The `connectToMongoDb` function handles the connection to the database
with the native MongoClient from mongodb. When calling this method we need to add a
`uri` parameter, which is our connection string to the database.

Because I have my collection in the `test` database I need to
reference it in the `db` constant. Lastly, I am pulling the `recipes`
collection from the database and set it to the recipes constant.

Now we need to call the function in our `server.ts` file and start the
express server.

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/server.ts*

[source,typescript]
----
import * as dotenv from "dotenv"
import express from "express"
import { connectToMongoDb } from "./database"
import { error } from "console";

dotenv.config();

const {CONNECTION_URI, EXPRESS_PORT} = process.env;

if (!CONNECTION_URI) {
    console.error("Missing connection URI in .env");
    process.exit(1);
}

if (!EXPRESS_PORT) {
    console.error("Missing express port in .env");
    process.exit(1);
}

connectToMongoDb(CONNECTION_URI)
.then(()=>{
    const app = express();
    
    app.listen(EXPRESS_PORT,()=>{
        console.log(`Server running on localhost:${EXPRESS_PORT}`);
    })
})
.catch(error=> console.error(error));
----

I am referencing two variables from my `.env` file, firstly the connection
string to the database and secondly, the port I want to run my express server on.
Please adjust the variables according to your credentials.

The `.env` file could look something like this:

....
CONNECTION_URI=mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin&readPreference=primary&ssl=false&directConnection=true
EXPRESS_PORT=5200
....

____
‚ùó Tip: You can obtain the connection string of your database by right-clicking
on the connection in the VS Code MongoDB extension -> `Copy Connection String`.
____

To prevent basic errors, I am checking if the variables do exist, and then
proceed to calling the `connectToMongoDb` function with the
`CONNECTION_URI` as a parameter. If the connection was successful, an Express server will be started on the
specified port.

Let‚Äôs see if this works. Enter this command to start the server:

& don't forget to start you docker container üòâ

[source,shell]
----
cd server
npx ts-node src/server.ts
----

Which gives the following output (if successful):

....
Server running on localhost:5200
....

Great, that‚Äôs it for the database connection! Let's move on to the backend implementation.


For this use-case we want to fetch multiple and a single recipe from the
database with GET requests and display them on the frontend.

=== Create REST Endpoints

'''''

Firstly, let us create the endpoints to fetch/update/delete data from the database.
For that, I‚Äôll use the router from express in the `recipe.routes.ts`
file.

The endpoints needed:

 - `/` -> GET all recipes
 - `/:id` -> GET one recipe by its id
 - `/` -> POST create a recipe
 - `/:id` -> PUT update a recipe
 - `/:id` -> DELETE a recipe

Start by exporting a constant of the router and tell it to use json.

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/recipe.routes.ts*

[source,typescript]
----
import * as express from "express";
import * as mongodb from "mongodb";
import { collections } from "./database";

export const recipeRouter = express.Router();
recipeRouter.use(express.json());
----

==== GET all/one recipe(s)

To add a new route to the router, you need to call the REST-operation method
on the router object and write an arrow function, which contains the logic.

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/recipe.routes.ts*

[source, typescript]
----
recipeRouter.get("/", async (_req, res) => {
    try {
        const recipes = await collections.recipes.find({}).toArray();
        res.status(200).send(recipes);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send(error.message);
    }       
});
----

Getting all recipes is fairly simple. I call the `get()` method on the router with the url and the arrow function to be executed.

In the try block I am using my `collections.recipes` instance from the
`database.js` file, to execute a find query on the collection. The query itself is empty, because I want all my recipes.

If everything went fine, we receive all recipes in an array along with a status code
of 200.

To receive just one recipe by it‚Äôs id, add the following to your
`recipe.routes.ts`

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/recipe.routes.ts*

[source,typescript]
----
recipeRouter.get("/:id",async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const id = req?.params.id;
        const recipe = await collections.recipes.findOne({_id: new mongodb.ObjectId(id)});

        if (recipe) {
            res.status(200).send(recipe)
        } else {
            res.status(404).send(`No recipe with id: ${id}`);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send(error.message);
    }
});
----

To find a recipe with a specified id, you need to extract it from the
request parameter and then use it in the query. Pay attention that you convert the
id to an `objectId`, otherwise the request will fail, e.g. not find anything.

If something is returned from the query the method returns a 200 along with the requested recipe,
else a 404 is sent (because no recipe exists with the id). Any other
error runs into the catch, which sends a status code of 500.

==== POST Create a recipe

To create a recipe with a POST request, we now need to create a new endpoint
calling the `.post()` method on the router.

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/recipe.routes.ts*

[source,typescript]
----
recipeRouter.post("/", async (req, res)=>{
    try {
        const recipeToInsert:Recipe = req.body;
        const insertedRecipe = await collections.recipes.insertOne(recipeToInsert);
        if(insertedRecipe.acknowledged) {
            res.status(201).send(insertedRecipe)
        } else {
            res.status(500).json({error: "Failed to create recipe."});
        }
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).json({error: error.message});
    }
})
----

The recipe the client wants to add lies in the body of the request, which
we can access with the `.body` function. Then we call the database and tell it
to insert the requested recipe. If it works, we send back the `insertedRecipe` object,
which contains the id of the newly created object. Otherwise we catch the error
and return it with a status code.

==== DELETE a recipe

Deleting is done by calling the `delete()` method on the router.
We can create a method that deletes a recipe by its id:

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/recipe.routes.ts*

[source, typescript]
----
recipeRouter.delete("/:id", async (req,res)=>{
    try{
        const id:string = req?.params.id;
        const deletedRecipe = await collections.recipes.deleteOne({_id:new mongodb.ObjectId(id)});

        if(deletedRecipe.deletedCount>0){
            res.status(202).send(deletedRecipe);
        } else if (deletedRecipe.deletedCount==0){
            res.status(404).json({error: "No recipe with id " + id});
        }
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).json({error: error.message});
    }
});
----

Again, we extract the id from the parameter and then call the database operation,
which is a `deleteOne()` statement. When the `deletedCount` is greater than 0
we have successfully deleted the recipe and can send a 202 (Accepted).

If the count is 0, which means no recipe with the id exists, we return a 404 error.
Any other error will be caught and sent back with a status code of 400, for example when the client
sends an invalid id.

==== PUT Update a recipe

"Whoops there's a typo in my recipe - let me fix that by updating it".

That's what PUT requests are for, updating an existing entity in the datastore.
In Express we can do so by calling the `put()` function on the router.

The put/update method for the recipes would look like this:

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/recipe.routes.ts*

[source,typescript]
----
recipeRouter.put("/:id", async(req,res)=>{
    try {
        const id:string = req?.params.id;
        const recipeWithChanges:Recipe = req.body;
        const updatedRecipe = await collections.recipes.updateOne({_id:new mongodb.ObjectId(id)}, {$set: recipeWithChanges});

        if (updatedRecipe.matchedCount>0 && updatedRecipe.modifiedCount>0){
            res.status(200).send(updatedRecipe);
        } else if (updatedRecipe.matchedCount==0){
            res.status(404).json({error: "No recipe with id " + id});
        } else if (updatedRecipe.matchedCount>0 && updatedRecipe.modifiedCount==0){
            res.status(304).send(updatedRecipe);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).json({error: error.message});
    }
});
----

One last time, we extract the id from the parameter and the new recipe version from the body.
Then we run an `updateOne()` query on the recipe collection to apply the changes the client wants.

If the update was successful (found a recipe and made some changes), a status code of 200 and the query result is sent.
If the query hasn't been able to find a recipe, a 404 is sent, and if the database didn't have to make any changes, because
the new and old version are the same, a 304 (Not modified) is sent to the client.

And that's it for the routes, we have all the CRUD operations ready to be consumed
by the frontend!

==== Register the routes

Just one more thing for the backend, then we can start building the Angular app üòÖ.

Currently, the Express server does not know about the recipe routes because we
did not register them, so we need to help him out here.

In the `server.ts`, before the `app.listen()` method call, add:

*mean-stack-example-app/server/src/server.ts*

[source,ts]
----
app.use("/recipes", recipeRouter);
----

Don't forget to restart your server after modifying this file!

=== Finally, the frontend (Angular)

For all my frontend gurus, now the fun part for you;)
Leave your Express server and Docker container running and switch over
to your client directory - that's where everything will happen now.

==== Create interfaces on client

'''''

To follow our type-safe principle, we need to establish types on the client as well.
We already created interfaces for the server and now we need them on our
client too.

If you have the question why we don‚Äôt make a shared library - that‚Äôs
because these interfaces defer a bit.

Either create a `recipe.ts` + `ingredient.ts` file in the `src/app/`
directory, or generate one with this command:

[source,shell]
----
ng generate interface recipe
ng generate interface ingredient
----

Open up the files and add the interface specification to them:

*mean-stack-example-app/client/src/app/ingredient.ts*

[source,ts]
----
export interface Ingredient {
    name?: string;
    quantity?: number;
    unit?: number;
    _id?: string;
}
----

*mean-stack-example-app/client/src/app/recipe.ts*

[source,ts]
----
export interface Recipe {
    title?: string;
    description?: string;
    category?: "breakfast" | "main course" | "snack" | "dessert";
    ingredients?: Ingredient[];
    instructions?: string;
    _id?: string;
}
----

Notice the difference from the server interfaces in the id attribute
(it‚Äôs just a string!) and all fields have a `?' so typescript doesn‚Äôt
throw any errors because of nullable fields.

==== Create service to communicate with Express API

'''''

Next we‚Äôll create an Angular service that handles the communication with
our API, an extra service separates the logic from the presentation layer.

Using the `ng generate service recipe` command, we can automatically
generate a boilerplate service class with a test (we‚Äôll need that later
on).

In the service file, we can add the following methods to call our backend
endpoints.

*mean-stack-example-app/client/src/app/recipe.service.ts*

[source,ts]
----
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class RecipeService {

  private url:String = "http://localhost:5200/api/recipes";

  constructor(private http:HttpClient) { }

  getAllRecipes(){
    return this.http.get<Recipe[]>(this.url+"/");
  }

  getSingleRecipe(id:String){
    return this.http.get<Recipe>(this.url+"/"+id);
  }

  createRecipe(recipe:Recipe){
    return this.http.post<unknown>(this.url+"/", recipe);
  }

  deleteRecipe(id:string){
    return this.http.delete<unknown>(this.url+"/"+id);
  }

  updateRecipe(id:string, recipe:Recipe){
    return this.http.put<unknown>(this.url+"/"+id, recipe);
  }
}
----

Since we‚Äôre writing a service that is used by other components, the
class needs to be annotated with the `@Injectable` annotation. The
constructor instantiates the `HttpClient` object, which handles the
request logic - this is a feature from Angular directly.

Why do we need to call the module through the constructor? Because
of dependency injection, a design pattern that is used by default in Angular.
This pattern creates more flexibility and modularity in the app, which is great.

The rest of the service consists of the 5 methods for making calls to the API.

What each method does, should be clear from the function names.
To use the HTTP client, you can simply write `this.http.[method]<type>` with the route
and needed data for the request.

Compared to other JavaScript frameworks this approach is a super
convenient way (and I think the best) to handle http requests equally across the app -
no more `await fetch()...` calls spread across the components ü•∞.

Moreover, it's great that you can tell Angular of which type the response will be,
taking care of the `attribute?` headache in TypeScript. For our application
we can specify the `<Recipe>` type on the methods - so the application assumes that the response is of type
recipe.

If you don't have an interface for a third-party API or just want a workaround, you can simply add the `<unknown>` type,
which is, as stated in the Angular Docs, a better approach than the `<any>` type.

All of these patterns make it a lot easier to work with the service on a component level,
which we‚Äôll take a look at now.

==== List all recipes component

'''''

The recipe-list component will handle all the presentation, styling and
logic for displaying all recipes. Create one by entering the following
command in your terminal:

[source,shell]
----
ng generate component recipe-list
----

Which should generate a folder inside the `app` directory with the
following structure:

[source,shell]
----
\---app
        ...
    \---recipe-list
            recipe-list.component.css
            recipe-list.component.html
            recipe-list.component.spec.ts
            recipe-list.component.ts
----

Four files make up the entire component:

* styling (`recipe-list.component.css`)
* presentation (`recipe-list.component.html`)
* test (`recipe-list.component.spec.ts`)
* logic (`recipe-list.component.ts`)

But why not everything in one file like React does? On one hand it‚Äôs
kind of a personal preference - you can do a single-file approach in
Angular too, you just need to change a few properties in the annotation.

But if you have seen React components before, you know they can get
pretty long and look like some delicious spaghetti(code) üçù.

Splitting the code into seperate files makes it look better and is
easier to maintain - and we follow an important principle: *Single
Concern*! Each file is only responsible for one part.

Now we can add the following html to the `recipe-list.component.html`
file:

*mean-stack-example-app/client/src/app/recipe-list/recipe-list.component.html*

[source,html]
----
<div class="p-8">
<header class="my-6">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Tasty Recipe List </h1>
    <h2 class="text-sm text-blue-500">by Andy</h2>
</header>

<main>
    <div class="recipe-list flex gap-6">
    @for (recipe of recipes; track recipe) {
        <div class="recipe flex flex-col gap-2 shadow-lg p-3 rounded-lg hover:shadow-xl hover:cursor-pointer transition-all bg-neutral-50">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-medium"><a href="/recipes/{{recipe._id}}">{{ recipe.title }}</a></h2>
            <div class="w-min text-nowrap category rounded-xl bg-blue-200 text-blue-500 px-2 py-1 text-sm ">{{ recipe.category }}</div>
            <p>{{ recipe.description }}</p>
            <div class="ingredients line-clamp-3 p-1 text-neutral-400">
                @for (ingredient of recipe.ingredients; track ingredient) {
                    <div>
                        <span>{{ingredient.quantity}} </span>
                        <span>{{ingredient.unit}} </span>
                        <span>{{ingredient.name}} </span>
                    </div>
                }
            </div>
        </div>
    } 
    </div>
</main>
</div>

Most of the code is for styling purposes, except the data references and
the brand-new syntax for html-logic in Angular 17!

In earlier versions of Angular you had to write syntax inside the html
tag itself (for example `*ngFor`), which makes it really confusing to
use when writing a bit more complex display logic. But thankfully the
Angular development team noticed that issue and you can now use @for,
@if etc. statements in your components!

This component uses @for to render a recipe card for each recipe inside
the recipes list, and a loop to render the ingredients.

To reference a variable from your component.ts file, you need to add two
curly brackets `{{variable}}` surrounding the variable name. Of course
the variable needs to be defined, which I did in the
`recipe-list.component.ts` file:

*mean-stack-example-app/client/src/app/recipe-list/recipe-list.component.ts*

[source,ts]
----
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { Recipe } from '../recipe';
import { RecipeService } from '../recipe.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-recipe-list',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  templateUrl: './recipe-list.component.html',
  styleUrl: './recipe-list.component.css'
})
export class RecipeListComponent implements OnInit{
  recipes:Recipe[] = [];

  constructor(private recipeService:RecipeService){}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.loadRecipes();
  }

  private loadRecipes(){
    this.recipeService.getAllRecipes().subscribe(res => {
      this.recipes = res;
      console.log(res);
    })
  }
}
----

In a nutshell, this code fetches the data and loads it into a variable,
so the html file can use it. For that, we are calling our
`getAllRecipes()` function from the `RecipeService` and set the recipes
variable to the result of the method request.

Since we always want the freshest data from the database we‚Äôll use the
`OnInit` interface, which whenever we access the `/recipes` page calls
the `ngOnInit()` function. And that function calls our load function to
receive and display the newest data.

With all that (fine seperated!) code, we get something that looks like
this:

image::/assets/recipe-list.png[Recipe List Component View]

If you looked closely, you may have noticed the link in the title of the
recipe. For this link to work, we need another component which displays
a single recipe in detail. Again, use the `ng generate component recipe`
command for that.

Before implementing anything, add the new route to the `app.routes.ts`
file by adding a new object to the array:

*mean-stack-example-app/client/src/app/app.routes.ts*

[source,ts]
----
...
{path: 'recipes/:id', component: RecipeComponent},
...
----

The `:id` is a placeholder for the dynamic id each recipe has.

And a bit more configuration: Since we‚Äôre using these dynamic ids, we
need to tell Angular that, otherwise it won‚Äôt work. Inside your
`app.config.ts`, add the following parameter to your `provideRouter()`
function:

[source,ts]
----
provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding())
----

Great! Now we can work out the component logic for a single recipe.

*mean-stack-example-app/client/src/app/recipe/recipe.component.ts*

[source,ts]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-recipe',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  templateUrl: './recipe.component.html',
  styleUrl: './recipe.component.css'
})
export class RecipeComponent {

  constructor(private recipeService:RecipeService) {}

  recipe:Recipe = {};
  
  @Input()
  set id(recipeId: string) {
    this.recipeService.getSingleRecipe(recipeId).subscribe(res=>{
      this.recipe = res;
    })
  }
}
----

The `set id()` function handles the data fetching using our service. You
need to name the function like the parameter you specified in the
routes, so Angular knows what you mean.

And that‚Äôs all! The html is pretty easy as well:

*mean-stack-example-app/client/src/app/recipe/recipe.component.html*

[source,html]
----
<div class="recipe flex flex-col gap-5 p-3 h-screen bg-neutral-50">
    <a href="/recipes" class="text-sm underline">üè†Back to home</a>
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium">{{ recipe.title }}</h2>
    <div class="w-min text-nowrap category rounded-xl bg-blue-200 text-blue-500 px-2 py-1 text-sm ">{{ recipe.category }}</div>
    <p>{{ recipe.description }}</p>
    <div class="ingredients p-1 text-neutral-400">
        @for (ingredient of recipe.ingredients; track ingredient) {
            <div>
                <span>{{ingredient.quantity}} </span>
                <span>{{ingredient.unit}} </span>
                <span>{{ingredient.name}} </span>
            </div>
        }
    </div>
    <p class="max-w-96">{{recipe.instructions}}</p>
</div>
